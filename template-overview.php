<p>J!Bootstrap - Twitter's Bootstrap for Joomla (with RocketTheme's Gantry administration).</p>

<h2>Overview of the J!Bootstrap</h2>

<p><b>J!Bootstrap</b> is a new kind of Joomla template. We've been working with Joomla since 2007, and we love to work and extend it. In the other hand, we've been following the last developments around Html5: Boilerplate, Bootstrap, initializr, KendoUI, Mustache, etc.<p>
   
<p></p>

<p>This is a new solution to combine Joomla and Bootstrap in a full template. To help us, we have also integrated in the template RocketTheme Gantry, as platform to build the theme.<p>

<p><b>Bootstrap</b>, from Twitter is a simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for popular user interface components and interactions.</p>

<dt>Built for and by nerds</dt>
<dd>Like you, we love building awesome products on the web. We love it so much, we decided to help people just like us do it easier, better, and faster. Bootstrap is built for you.</dd>

<dt>For all skill levels</dt>
<dd>Bootstrap is designed to help people of all skill levelsâ€”designer or developer, huge nerd or early beginner. Use it as a complete kit or use to start something more complex.</dd>

<dt>Cross-everything</dt>
<dd>Originally built with only modern browsers in mind, Bootstrap has evolved to include support for all major browsers (even IE7!) and, with Bootstrap 2, tablets and smartphones, too.</dd>

<dt>12-column grid</dt>
<dd>Grid systems aren't everything, but having a durable and flexible one at the core of your work can make development much simpler. Use our built-in grid classes or roll your own.</dd>

<dt>Responsive design</dt>
<dd>With Bootstrap 2, we've gone fully responsive. Our components are scaled according to a range of resolutions and devices to provide a consistent experience, no matter what.</dd>

<dt>Styleguide docs</dt>
<dd>Unlike other front-end toolkits, Bootstrap was designed first and foremost as a styleguide to document not only our features, but best practices and living, coded examples.</dd>

<dt>Growing library</dt>
<dd>Despite being only 10kb (gzipped), Bootstrap is one of the most complete front-end toolkits out there with dozens of fully functional components ready to be put to use.</dd>

<dt>Custom jQuery plugins</dt>
<dd>What good is an awesome design component without easy-to-use, proper, and extensible interactions? With Bootstrap, you get custom-built jQuery plugins to bring your projects to life.</dd>

<dt>Built on LESS</dt>
<dd>Where vanilla CSS falters, LESS excels. Variables, nesting, operations, and mixins in LESS makes coding CSS faster and more efficient with minimal overhead.</dd>

 is a sophisticated framework with the sole intention of being the best platform to build a solid theme with.
    Gantry takes all the lessons learned during the development of many RocketTheme Joomla templates and WordPress
    Themes and distills that knowledge into a single super-flexible framework that is easy to configure, simple to
    extend, and powerful enough to handle anything we want to throw at it.</p>
