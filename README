Twitter's Bootstrap for Joomla

Jootstrap is a new kind of Joomla template. We've been working 
with Joomla since 2007, and we love to work and extend it. In the 
other hand, we've been following the last developments around Html5: 
Boilerplate, Bootstrap, initializr, KendoUI, and Mustache.

Jootstrap is a solution to combine Joomla and Bootstrap in a full 
template. To help us in the backend management, we have also 
integrated in the powerfull RocketTheme Gantry framework, as 
platform to build the theme.

We've already researched and done the hard work to combine both 
technologies in one single package. Now, it's ready to update Joomla 
to a full Html5 World!
