J!Bootstrap

Twitter's Bootstrap for Joomla

J!Bootstrap is a new kind of Joomla template. We've been working with Joomla since 2007, and we love to work and extend it. In the other hand, we've been following the last developments around Html5: Boilerplate, Bootstrap, initializr, KendoUI, and Mustache.

J!Bootstrap is a solution to combine Joomla and Bootstrap in a full template. To help us in the backend management, we have also integrated in the powerfull RocketTheme Gantry framework, as platform to build the theme.

We've already researched and done the hard work to combine both technologies in one single package. Now, it's ready to update Joomla to a full Html5 World!
